# TU Delft - Unofficial Report Template (v1.4.1)

This template aims to simplify and improve the (Xe)LaTeX template provided by the TU Delft. Major changes are a redesigned cover page and a rewritten class file for easier customization. Some of the main features:

* **Quick Start:** Many common packages are included by default to get started immediately;
* **Simple:** A class file that has been reduced by over 60% to simplify customization;
* **Effortless:** Minor enhancements and features to keep focused on writing, such as a nomenclature that flows over page boundaries automatically.

This template works with _pdfLaTeX_, _XeLaTeX_ and _LuaLaTeX_. In order to adhere to the TU Delft house style, either _XeLaTeX_ or _LuaLaTeX_ is required, as it supports TrueType and OpenType fonts. _BibLaTeX_ is used for the bibliography with as backend _biber_.
