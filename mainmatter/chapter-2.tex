        & • & Redesigned the cover page \\

        & • & Changed the font to Arial to be in line with the TU Delft corporate design \\
        & • & Fixed and added more book entries from 2nd year courses (e.g. \cite{anderson-fundamentals-of-aerodynamics,megson-aircraft-structures}) \\
        & • & Converted the nomenclature tables to longtables which will break automatically over the page \\
        \midrule
        1.2.0 & • & Added more cover images. A detailed list with all attributions can be found on the next page. All images can be used and distributed freely if appropriate credit is given (all use a CC BY 2.0 license or similar) \\
